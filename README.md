# Introduction 

## Problem Formulation

Our project is based on an AYR credit scheme, where the main goal is to incentivise
more sustainable behaviours and to influence people to reduce their carbon footprint. The
group will create a simulation model and test it on a social simulation platform.
We will use a What-if analysis and two different models in order to build a valid,
coherent, and precise simulation. The two models we are going to use are:

- Prescriptive Model: In our project, we will study what transformations we can
make in order to improve our system. In our specific case, study the different credit
schemes or incentives that can be implemented by private companies in order to make
their employees more sustainable and reduce the overall carbon footprint.
- Speculative Model: This model will also be very important because we will use
different scenarios to test the new operation policies and different configurations of
our system and analyse them in terms of performance. Furthermore, the scenarios to
be simulated correspond to systems that do not exist yet.

The What-if analysis will also be crucial to our project. It will allow us to inspect the
behaviour of our complex system and assess how changes in a set of independent variables
(such as the scheme implemented by the companies) impact a set of dependent variables
(like transport usage or CO2 emissions).

## Problem description
Some companies are aiming to encourage their employees to adopt more sustainable
commuting habits by introducing a benefits or credit scheme designed to incentivise eco-
friendly travel choices
